        "Description": "Bio-Flux Specialty Combat doesn\u2019t wait for the slow bio-invigorator. You may now use bio-invigoration for only 2 action points. Medical Marvel Bio-Flux Specialty You can heal beyond a person\u2019s maximum hit points. If you over-heal somebody, the excess hit points stays with them until the end of their turn (when their action points refresh). If their excess hit points are damaged, then that damage is simply negated. For example, you use bio-invigoration on a friend who has a maximum of 50 hit points. He is over-healed, granting him 5 extra hit points. Before the end of his next turn, he is stabbed by an attack that deals 4 hit points, leaving him at 51. His turn ends, and his hit points are reduced to 50, effectively leaving him unharmed. "
