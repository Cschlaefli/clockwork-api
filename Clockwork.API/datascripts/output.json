At any given moment, you can craft an item on the fly, acting as though you already had it. It must be concealable (thus, you can\u2019t just pull a tank or heavy rifle out of your pocket). You can only do this once between downtimes, and the item must be something you know how to craft (as in, you have taken the basic crafting specialty for the item and any augments you are going to put on it). The Cost of Prototyping Many inventors can produce beta objects: creations that exceed the normal augment limit of 3. These beta designs, however, are so difficult to use that only the original inventor can typically control them. But while many crafters can build betas, very few can build prototypes. Prototypes are objects that exceed the typical augment limit of 3 but that anybody can use. The materials cost for creating the extra augments for prototypes is the same as it always is. However, because prototypes are so rare, those who create them will typically inflate the price for the extra effort and skill required to craft the items. When buying off the market, the extra 2 augments that prototypes allow will often be double the price of the normal 3 augment item. c Augments with the Same Name c Sometimes, you\u2019ll find an \u201cAccurate\u201d augment under bow augments and an \u201cAccurate\u201d augment under weapon augments. They might have slightly different flavor text, but they do the exact same thing. Well, if you learn one, you\u2019ve learned the other. Anytime you learn an augment, you know that augment regardless of which section of the book it falls under. If you learn how to craft firearms, crossbows, bows, and melee weapons, there is no need to learn the \u201cDamaging\u201d augment 4 different times. Just learn it once, and you\u2019re good to go! Alchemy Skill Alchemy allows a person to create everything from basic acid to chemical weaponry. Alchemy uses chemicals to create a variety of potent solutions. Chemical weapons have gone into rapid development over the past fifty years, yet the usage of poisons, medicinal potions, and numerous other alchemic substances has been around for centuries. An alchemist can bring great diversity to any group, being most noteworthy for his or her healing abilities. Beyond medicinal, alchemist have a wide repertoire of explosives, corrosives, gases, and poisons. This is not a person you want to see on a bad day. Using Potions Potions find themselves being thrown around combat in all sorts of ways: a friendly toss to an ally, a deadly throw at an opponent, jabbed down someone\u2019s throat, smashed into the ground at your feet, or poured over a wound. Here are some basic rules for using potions. Drawing & Drinking c Drawing and drinking a potion can be one smooth action that costs one action point. It does leave you open to melee reflexes: reflexive attack, reflexive called shot to the lower arm (disarm), or a reflexive called shot to the wielded item (sunder, this time to the potion). Be careful of drinking in combat! Throwing c You may throw a potion at an enemy. You must have already drawn the weapon in order to do so. Attacking somebody with it requires 2 AP, and it deals damage as an unarmed weapon. Potions have a range of 25 feet. If you miss with a potion, it lands nearby and breaks. The narrator will determine if it lands on the space the enemy was in or near them. You can also toss a potion to an ally. This works in much the same way, except you need not roll accuracy and evade - unless, of course, the ally doesn\u2019t want it! (For the ally to catch the toss, they must have one hand free, but it doesn\u2019t cost any action points. They can drink it for 1 action point, as per normal, but may do so reflexively when they catch it.) Applying Poison to a Weapon c You can apply a poison to a weapon for 3 action points. Doing so coats the weapon. The first time that the weapon deals damage (after damage soak), the poison is used. You can\u2019t coat a bullet with a poison, and a weapon can only be coated in one poison at a time. p Immunity Specialties M "

All medicinal potions must be injected or ingested. Without spending any money, you can brew and maintain several medicines based on your current Do-It-Yourself (DIY) score. These medicines can then be upgraded with augments. You\u2019ll learn 2 augments from this specialty, which can be selected under \u201cmedicine augments\u201d below. These augments have marques. At lower levels, you\u2019ll start with Marque I augments. As your skill in Alchemy improves, your marques will increase. See the \u201cCrafting\u201d page at the beginning of this chapter for more information. Each medicine can be upgraded with 3 augments. Sometimes an augment will take up multiple augment slots. For example, the \u201cheavy push\u201d augment is worth 3 slots, so a medicine has 0 available slot for an augment after \u201cheavy push\u201d has been applied. Number of Medicines you can Maintain \u00a0z Without needing to buy chemicals, you can brew some medicines entirely out of scraps. These medicines must be constantly maintained by you and stop working soon after leaving your care. You may build and maintain a number of medicines based on your DIY score. You may brew new medicines or augment old ones during any period of downtime you have. The Cost of Medicines z If you need to brew a medicines that you can\u2019t create for free from your DIY score, you will need to buy the materials for it. Every augment will increase the price. The higher the marque, the greater the price. The market price for an augment can be found in the chart below. If you are brewing the augment, you pay 1/5th the price, which is the same as if you were buying an augment one marque lower. (As in, the material cost for a Marque III augment is the market price for a Marque II augment.) The material cost for a Marque 1 augment is 8 dukes. "

        "Description": "Poisons are rarely seen as the most savory tools of war; nonetheless, they remain ever popular. Poisons kill, disable, and bring great discomfort to those injected with them. Poisons are always a little difficult to find, requiring a tier 2 Cunning result to notice. A person can always volunteer to look at something to see if it is poisoned, such as trying to notice poison on a sword or in a drink. Poisons must either be consumed by the target or injected (as can happen on the battlefield, when a blade is coated in poison). The basic poison will activate within the target after the target has used 3 action points. Without spending any money, you can brew and maintain several poisons based on your current Do-It-Yourself (DIY) score. These poisons can then be upgraded with augments. You\u2019ll learn 2 augments from this specialty, which can be selected under \u201cpoison augments\u201d below. These augments have marques.

For example, the \u201challucinogenic\u201d augment is worth 2 slots, so a poison only has 1 available slot for an augment after \u201challucinogenic\u201d has been applied. Resisting Poisons z All poisons can be resisted with a Brute roll. For every tier of Brute rolled above Tier 1, the marque of the poison is reduced by 1.

        "Description": "The first step in crafting your steamer, boilers are the machinery that powers your automaton and gives it motion and strength. \u00a0Your boiler is automatically housed within the automaton\u2019s torso, onto which you can attach any body parts you wish. Without spending any money, you can build and maintain several steamers based on your current Do-It-Yourself (DIY) score. The boilers in these steamers can then be upgraded with augments.

For example, the \u201cFlight\u201d augment is worth 2 slots, so a boiler only has 1 more available slot for an augment after \u201cFlight\u201d has been applied. Number of Steamers you can Maintain \u00a0z Without needing to buy pieces or parts, you can build some steamers entirely out of scraps. These automatons must be constantly maintained by you and stop working soon after leaving your care. You may build and maintain a number of steamers for free based on your DIY score. You may build new steamers or augment old ones during any period of downtime you have. The Cost of Steamers z If you need to build a steamer that you can\u2019t build for free from your DIY score, you will need to buy the materials for it. A steamer without augments will cost 50 princes. If you are building a steamer, the steamer will have a base materials cost. It is 1/5th the market price (10 princes). Every augment will increase the price. The higher the marque, the greater the price. The market price for an augment can be found in the chart below. If you are building the augment, you pay 1/5th the price, which is the same as if you were buying an augment one marque lower. (As in, the material cost for a Marque III augment is the market price for a Marque II augment.) The material cost for a Marque 1 augment is 10 princes. Using your Steamer Back in the day, steam-powered automatons used coal, so they were often large, hulking affairs that moved slowly and ate up a lot of fuel. Emperor Deylus Luthricien and the royalists changed that during the civil war when they integrated aether technology into their boilers for easier steam generation. \u00a0Now, steam-powered automatons are fast, lighter-weight, and can be controlled via remote controls and radio waves. Control Method c Steamers require the use of a two-handed remote control, emitting radio waves to the aether resonators inside the automatons. These remote controls allow the user to be up to 100 feet away and still control the automaton. The automaton can generally do anything a normal person could do (such as walking, jumping, fighting, and deflecting), and it takes the controller the same amount of action points to control the automaton as it would for a normal person to make the action (such as 1 action point to make the automaton move, or 2 action points to make the automaton attack). A single remote control can be used to control all of your automatons. Steamers have no action points of their own; therefore, if your steamer is hit with an attack that lowers its number of action points, your steamer is unaffected. Body of the Machine c Steamers will have a Boiler, which will be augmentable with 3 slots. One may later take Beta Boiler to improve on that. Body parts may then be added to the boiler. Your steamer (by default) is built with a head to house its radio receptors and a torso and groin to house its boiler. The two are connected via a neck support. To its torso you may attach either two arms or one unit of movement. Its groin may have a unit of movement attached to it. A unit of movement is either a set of legs, wheels, or a propulsion device. (See the Units of Movement sidebar for more information.) Your steamer has 0 hit points and 30 wounds. Any \u201cbleeding\u201d damage your steamer takes causes steam to erractically leak out of its boiler, making it take bleeding damage in the same fashion as any regular organism. In addition, the rigid structuring of your steamer\u2019s boiler grants it an extra 3 soak class. As your automaton has no mind of its own, it cannot be affected by anything that requires Spirit or Cunning as a resist. Units of Movement Automatons will normally have a unit of movement attached to them. This could be a set of legs, wheels, or a propulsion device. Legs c Legs provide movement. Legs can easily traverse almost any terrain. By having a set of legs (typically two), an automaton will have a speed of 20 feet, can walk up stairs, move over all degrees rough terrain, and generally have little problem getting about as do most tephrans. The legs do not allow the automaton to climb or swim. By having legs, the automaton can be affected by called shots to the legs. Wheels c Wheels allow for faster movement, though their are some clear disadvantages compared to legs. Wheels will give the automaton a speed of 30 feet, but the automaton will only be able to go up stairs at a speed of 10 feet, and the penalties for moving through rough terrain are doubled. The wheels do not allow the automaton to climb or swim. Wheels can be targeted as called shot locations - they have the same effects as legs. Propulsion Device c Sometimes legs and wheels don\u2019t cut it. Underwater automatons will have propellers or automated fins. Some automatons will stand on wheels but use a rocket to propel them forward. A propulsion device will allow the automaton a speed of 20 feet (on either land, surface waters, or under water). The penalties for moving through rough terrain are doubled, and the propulsion device does not allow the automaton to climb or swim (unless the propulsion device is intended for underwater movement, in which case it does not allow the automaton to move across the land). If a propulsion device is targeted as a called shot location, it has the same effect as if it were a leg. "

Luckily for you, there\u2019s an easy solution: give that unfeeling automaton some feelings! Your brainworks can now be built with personality, making the fuse box you put them into feel the same emotional sensations as any other Tephran. This gives them the ability to gain stories (including ones from your nationality) and learn specialties from the Spirit attribute. Buying fuse boxes with personality costs 5,000 princes (a materials cost of 1,000 princes) on top of any other costs. Note: They still cannot gain DIY or augments through stories or specialties. Using your Fuse Box The first electric-powered automatons were invented by the Hazards, and later the technology was adapted and used to create numerous smaller and more efficient automatons that would protect the Hazardlands. Many Evanglessians called electric-powered automatons \u201cSparkers\u201d or \u201cFuse Boxes.\u201d Fuse Boxes have the most advanced sensory arrays, and can compute information to such an extent that they seem almost lifelike. This artificial intelligence is known as brainworks. Control Method c Fuse boxes use their brainworks to act independently. They begin as creations with 2 action points per turn. The sensory array allows the creator to give it verbal commands, like telling it to \u201cattack that man\u201d or \u201crun to my side,\u201d which costs the creator no action points. Your fuse box must roll priority separately from you as it is an autonomous being with its own turns. Body of the Machine c Fuse Boxes will begin with Brainworks, which has 3 slots that can be augmented. This can be upgraded with Advanced Brainworks, which gives the automaton more control over itself and an additional 2 slots for its brainworks. Body parts can then be added onto the brainworks. Your fuse box (by default) is built with a head to house its brainworks and a torso and groin to house its drive core. The two are connected via a neck support. To its torso you may attach either two arms or one unit of movement. Its groin may have a unit of movement attached to it. A unit of movement is either a set of legs, wheels, or a propulsion device. (See the Units of Movement sidebar for more information.) Your fuse box\u2019s integrity comes from the electricity its brainworks produces, which at default is 8 hit points. Once out of hit points its brainworks is exposed and your automaton will begin to take wounds damage. Fuse boxes have only 12 points of wounds. Any \u201cbleeding\u201d damage your automaton takes causes lightning to shoot out of its electrical conduit, making it take bleeding damage in the same fashion as any regular organism. Fuse boxes have 2 action points per turn. As sentient machines, fuse boxes can learn specialties based on their marque. They act as if they have 1 point in the skills they have specialties in for the purposes of prerequisites and for the specialty itself. This point does not increase their attributes at all.

        "Description": "Your analytics go far beyond what most other automata builders could conceptually imagine. Such analytics have two more slots for you to place augments into. Using your Clockworks Clockwork automatons are the oldest automatons, as Velkya, the founder of Evangless, was fond of using them. Clockwork automatons have come a long way, however, and now use analytical engines to evaluate their surroundings and enact pre-programmed responses. Clockworks can now work for hours and hours without needing any maintenance (or winding up, as it would be). Control Method c Clockworks work by using pre-programmed responses called Directives. Without a Directive augmented onto them, a clockwork will not make any actions. Each directive acts separately from the rest. Clockworks don\u2019t have action points, and require no action points from its master to function. Therefore if your clockwork is hit with an attack that lowers its number of action points for a turn, your clockwork is unaffected. Outside of combat you can temporarily turn off and on some (or all) of your clockwork\u2019s directives to avoid it attacking townsfolk. Body of the Machine c Clockworks will begin with an analytical engine, which has 3 slots to be augmented with pre-programmed responses. This can be upgraded with Advanced Analytics, which allows for 2 more slots. Some crafters learn how to make punch cards, to re-program their clockworks on the spots. Body parts can then be added onto the analytical engine. Your clockwork (by default) is built with a head to house its analytical engine and a torso and groin to house its perpetual motion clockwork. The two are connected via a neck support. To its torso you may attach either two arms or one unit of movement. Its groin may have a unit of movement attached to it. A unit of movement is either a set of legs, wheels, or a propulsion device. (See the Units of Movement sidebar for more information.) Clockworks have no hit points and 20 points of wounds. Any \u201cbleeding\u201d damage your automaton takes causes springs and cogs to pop out of place within its clockwork, making it take bleeding damage in the same fashion as any regular organism. "

        "Description": "You now have the ability to craft mechanical prosthetics onto people or augment the limbs of automatons. When you create a prosthetic for a person, it works as a limb replacement. Of course, once you affix your prosthetics with hidden cannons, chainsaws, and ridiculous pistons, the comparison stops there. Without spending any money, you can build and maintain several prosthetics based on your current Do-It-Yourself (DIY) score. The prosthetics can then be upgraded with augments. You\u2019ll learn 2 augments from this specialty, which can be selected under \u201cuniversal prosthetic augments,\u201d \u201cprosthetic arm augments,\u201d \u201cprosthetic hand augments,\u201d or \u201cprosthetic leg augments,\u201d below. These augments have marques. At lower levels, you\u2019ll start with Marque I augments. As your skill in Automata improves, your marques will increase. See the \u201cCrafting\u201d page at the beginning of this chapter for more information. Each prosthetic can be upgraded with 3 augments. Some materials can only be upgraded twice (like wooden prosthetics) or just once (like organic ones). Sometimes an augment will take up multiple augment slots. For example, if an augment is worth 2 slots, a prosthetic only has 1 more available slot for an augment after the 2-slot augment has been applied. Number of Prosthetics you can Maintain \u00a0z Without needing to buy pieces or parts, you can build some prosthetics entirely out of scraps. These prosthetics must be constantly maintained by you and stop working soon after leaving your care. You may build and maintain a number of prosthetics for free based on your DIY score. You may build new prosthetics or augment old ones during any period of downtime you have. Replacing both an arm and hand does count as 2 prosthetics. The Cost of Prosthetics z If you need to build prosthetics that you can\u2019t build for free from your DIY score, you will need to buy the materials for it. A prosthetic without augments will cost 25 princes at market value. If you are building a prosthetic, the prosthetic will have a base materials cost. It is 1/5th the market price (5 princes). Every augment will increase the price. The higher the marque, the greater the price. The market price for an augment can be found in the chart below. If you are building the augment, you pay 1/5th the price, which is the same as if you were buying an augment one marque lower. (As in, the material cost for a Marque III augment is the market price for a Marque II augment.) The material cost for a Marque 1 augment is 5 princes. Using Prosthetics When you first learn to make prosthetics (through the Prosthetician specialty), you can make and augment hands, arms, and legs. If somebody is missing a hand, arm, or leg, you can replace it with a prosthetic. The only lasting penalty to having a prosthetic limb is the permanent loss of wounds that come from losing a limb. Universal prosthetic augments can go on any prosthetics. Wounds & Fatals c If you suffer a wound or fatal effect against a prosthetic, the effect is the same, except that you cannot bleed out by having a severed prosthetic. Upgrading Automaton Limbs c You can add prosthetics onto an automaton or augment its default limbs. If you upgrade the existing limbs, it counts against your limit of prosthetics you can make and maintain with your DIY score. "

The market price for an augment can be found in the chart below. If you are building the augment, you pay 1/5th the price, which is the same as if you were buying an augment one marque lower. (As in, the material cost for a Marque III augment is the market price for a Marque II augment.) The material cost for a Marque I augment is 1 prince and 6 dukes. "

        "Description": "While you\u2019re friends are out there becoming master swordsmen and crafting great war-engines, you\u2019ve been learning how to craft goggles. You can now create eyewear. Unless you\u2019ve gained extra eyes or somehow have grafted eyewear, you are limited to looking through one piece of eyewear. Even if you have multiple sets of eyes, you can only look through a single piece of eyewear at a time. Without spending any money, you can build and maintain several sets of eyewear based on your current Do-It-Yourself (DIY) score. These eyewears can then be upgraded with augments. You\u2019ll learn 2 augments from this specialty, which can be selected under \u201ceyewear augments\u201d below. These augments have marques. At lower levels, you\u2019ll start with Marque I augments. As your skill in Gadgetry improves, your marques will increase. See the \u201cCrafting\u201d page at the beginning of this chapter for more information. Each eyewear can be upgraded with 3 augments. Some materials can only be upgraded twice (like wooden eyewear) or just once (like organic ones). Sometimes an augment will take up multiple augment slots. For example, the \u201calert\u201d augment is worth 3 slots, so an eyewear has 0 more available slot for an augment after \u201calert\u201d has been applied. Number of Eyewears you can Maintain \u00a0z Without needing to buy pieces or parts, you can build some sets of eyewear entirely out of scraps. These eyewears must be constantly maintained by you and stop working soon after leaving your care. You may build and maintain a number of eyewears based on your DIY score. You may build new eyewears or augment old ones during any period of downtime you have. The Cost of Eyewear z If you need to build eyewear that you can\u2019t build for free from your DIY score, you will need to buy the materials for it. Every augment will increase the price.
